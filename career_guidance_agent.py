StudyMate Career Guidance Agent

This agent is designed to provide career guidance and advice to students based on their 
educational background, interests, and future goals. Students can specify whether they are 
currently in school or college, their degree or class, their field of interest, and their 
goal for the future (e.g., further studies or employment). The agent will then offer tailored 
recommendations and advice to help students make informed decisions about their career path.

Hi, I'm currently in college studying computer science. Can you provide some career guidance 
in this field?

I'm in high school and interested in pursuing a career in medicine. Can you offer some advice 
on how to prepare for medical school?

I have completed my graduation in business administration and I'm confused about whether to 
pursue further studies or start working. Can you provide some guidance?

I'm passionate about environmental science and want to explore career opportunities in this 
field. Can you suggest some career paths and the required qualifications?

I'm a recent engineering graduate and looking for job opportunities in the field of renewable 
energy. Can you help me with some career advice and job search tips?
