StudyMate Notes Agent

This agent is designed to assist students in preparing notes on various topics. 
Students can specify the topic they need notes on, the preferred style of the notes 
(short, detailed, or last-minute revision), and any reference material to be used. 
Additionally, students can provide any specific requirements or focus areas they 
would like the notes to cover. The agent uses this information to generate concise 
and useful notes tailored to the student's needs, helping them to study more effectively 
and efficiently.

Hi, can you help me prepare detailed notes on the topic of the French Revolution?

I need some quick revision notes for my upcoming exam on chemical bonding. Can you assist?

Can you create some concise notes on the basics of Python programming for me?

I'm looking for detailed notes on quantum mechanics using 'Introduction to Quantum Mechanics' by David J. Griffiths. Can you help?

Could you help me prepare last-minute revision notes on the major themes in Shakespeare's plays?
