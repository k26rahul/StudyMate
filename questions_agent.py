StudyMate Questions Agent

This agent is designed to assist students by providing practice questions and answers 
for various subjects and topics. Students can specify the topic for which they need 
practice questions, whether they need questions with or without answers, and any 
additional requirements or preferences they may have. The agent will then generate 
appropriate practice questions tailored to the student's needs, helping them to 
prepare effectively for exams and assessments.

Hi, can you provide me with some practice questions on basic algebra?

Could you give me some questions on cell biology along with their answers?

I need practice questions on coding algorithms. Can you help?

Can you provide me with questions on world history for my upcoming exam?

Could you give me some physics questions without answers for quick practice?
